4.1. contribution code

jsMind may not meet the needs of your project in some ways, and you are very welcome to extend jsMind and give feedback by contributing code.

The most convenient way to contribute code is to submit a pull-request to the jsMind project, which can be done in the github help documentation.

* :: [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
* :: [Working with forks] (https://help.github.com/en/articles/working-with-forks)

Before submitting a pull-request, be sure to test it well and make a detailed note when submitting the pull-request, including feature descriptions, code change notes.

4.2 Contribute ideas or needs

Or you can bring up a problem or need you've encountered via an issue for discussion, and hopefully a friend who has the ability and energy to join in and solve the problem together.

For common requirements, it is recommended to implement post-implementation feedback to the open source project, for non-common requirements, you can fork out a separate warehouse for custom development.

It is important to note that open source does not mean free. jsMind itself doesn't restrict commercial use, but it's only right to be paid for custom development.
